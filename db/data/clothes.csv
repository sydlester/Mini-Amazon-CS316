I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}

This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car.",,

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.

Well I purchased a burgundy which appears to be a beautiful raspberry on both my iPhone and iPad. And it actually truly is a very doll burgundy. Secondly I had expected a knit fabric and this is a broadcloth  type fabric, you know the type of men shirts are made out of but with lots of stretch to it. And I'm worried that the dye looks rather cheap, that it might wash out and look very very faded after only two or three washes.

The shoes are light as a feather.  We'll see how they hold up, but I plan to wear them everywhere.  They have an insert that reminds me of one I used to buy for high heels.

They look very sharp!  I wear them with or without socks, with pants, with jeans, with shorts.  I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and these shoes are just so comfortable.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam.  The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry.  The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my legs warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot.
I have noticed that when something rubs against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls. They also attract animal hair like crazy. If you have pets you will probably become frustrated with this. However, I've noticed that this is common with ALL fleece leggings so I am not removing a star for it - only letting other customer's know what to expect.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another.",,

His feet were always squishing in cotton socks and his socks were nasty in the laundry.  He insisted on his thick cotton Thorlo socks because they had padding where he liked it for long runs.  Finally!  I came across this moisture wicking Thorlo sock that has most of the same padding especially in the bottom areas.  He put them on after a race.  Now, let me tell you after a race, he is sweating so much he looks like he just stepped out of a shower.  Amazingly, his feet remained dry even though he was soaking wet everywhere else.  Afterwards, these socks did not pollute the laundry basket like the soaked cotton socks.  His only concern is they don't have quite as much padding on the top of the sock as his other cotton Thorlos so they may not be good for running down hills, but we don't have a lot of hills where we live.  So that isn't a problem unless we start travelling to running races again.",,

I'm a woman, and was looking for a small, lightweight messenger style bag that would fit my wallet, keys, phone & other small necessities as well as my iPad, pencil, battery charger, cords... Etc. I wanted something sturdy, simple and well designed, but that appealed to my style. This bag met all my requirements and I've been really impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. I'm surprised at how roomy it is for what I feel is a smaller bag - even loaded up with all my stuff, I've always had room to spare.
During shipping, the box was slightly damaged and the bottom front corner of the bag was dented when I unpacked it. I decided to keep it, hoping with use it would work itself out with use, but it didn't and the dent remains. It adds character... That's what I'm going with :)
The only other thing I would wish for is an extra metal slide or something to keep the loops of the long strap together. When I shorten the strap, the strap doubles across itself and doesn't function well as a single strap when I go to grab it quickly... Just a minor thing really.

I gave them to my daughter for her birthday and she LOVES them (well, love may not be strong enough of a word here...).

They are platinum plated, sterling silver so they won't turn your skin green like the fake stuff usually does. They stay affixed like they ought to and more importantly, they LOOK like diamonds.

They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.

The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot. You can buy a bunch of these in different colors, if you want to have fashionable colorful sneakers but you don't want to develop foot and back pain.

And let's face it, by the way -- if you're walking around all the time, doing errands and exercise, and all that sort of thing, most sneakers are going to wear out pretty quickly. At least these are lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable -- and they don't break the bank!",,

With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"This is a very nice looking shoe if it fits correctly.  I have a normal sized ankle and calf.  The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.  The only other issue I had was some rubbing of my baby toe which is not a defect of the shoe.  I think once warn a few more times and broken in they will be pretty good.  I have a wide foot so tend to buy a 1/2 size up for comfort.  They fit as expected for an average to wide foot. I would buy them again in another color and plan to when the price is right!",,

They are very soft and a good quality for the price.I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it fits great!I'm a huge fan of the rose gold that I've bought at the top of this boot.  The reason I bought this boot was because it has a lot of cushioning.  I've had a few pairs of this boot and the ones that I've had have stayed on my feet well.  It was very hard to get them on and I thought it was a little too tight for my feet.  The material is good and the boot was very soft.  I'll wear this boot for a while, but I'm very pleased",,
,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I am a long time Skechers shoe wearer for two reasons: 1. I have worn them for fifteen years and 2. I need a wide shoe, which Skechers has always had, which is why I have worn them for fifteen years.

The pilot is one of my go-to boots. I wear the hell out of them and buy a new pair every other year depending on what I put them through. I wear them for dress, for work, for hiking, for fishing. They hold up very well, always look good, and are always comfortable.

The biggest reason I wear them is that I can trust the size. I wear a 13 EE and over the years the fit has always been true. That's a huge relief since buying a good, wide, boot or show is a serious PITA.

The boots are not without their short comings but these are, relative to the price, minor things. The shoe-lace metalic tabs get lose eventually and bend and require a pair of pliers to bend back and keep in place. But, like I said, this is a minor thing.

And, like I said, I do beat up on these boots pretty bad. But the heel always wears well, never breaks or falls apart, the leather holds up great and the comfort stays until I buy a new pair.

I obviously cannot recommend them enough.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"These fit well. They tuck well. They definitely make hot weather easier to manage if you wear multiple layers.
My two complaints:
1) The collar is sized in a manner that often you are left feeling the tag of your outer shirt on your neck, which can be annoying, especially if you are wearing sunscreen. Sometimes this collar will ""roll up"" too. I assume this is from the type of material used.
2) Due to the material of the shirt, your outer shirt tends to come untucked, ballooning much sooner into your work day. This, again, is likely due to the material of the shirt, as there is minimal friction between the undershirt and the outer shirt. This untucking is exacerbated if your outer shirt happens to be moisture wicking (low friction at the underside, usually).
While I really do appreciate what these shirts do, I cannot imagine spending the same amount of money on another two. If the price was a bit less, then yes. However, for the money, there are a plethora of other brands that have extremely similar materials (literally two sides of the same coin at this juncture of clothing technology), that likely perform just as well. Since it is an undershirt, how much does brand really matter? IF brand does matter to you, then know these do what they advertise, but come with a few caveats.",,

I saw a similar one at Macy's that was twice the price and I am so glad I waited for this one to arrive instead, it looks even better than it does online. I ordered a large but the seller sent a medium (prob because sold out of large?) and it fits perfectly. I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool. The stiffness will help the cape keep it's shape over time. And the collar comes up slightly in the back of the next which gives it a little flair and elegance, especially when your hair is pinned up! It is very high quality and the arm holes are in exactly the right place and provide a good range of movement. The snaps on the front are very sturdy and hidden when the cape is completely closed, no buttons or zips to ruin the sleek, simple style. I can throw this on with jeans and equestrian boots for a day out running errands, or cocktail attire for an evening out...this is definitely a piece that should be added to every wardrobe.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I think I own about 10 pair of Cushe shoes, probably more. They are about the only brand of casual shoes I wear. I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks. If you have not tried them and want a super comfortable shoe, obviously since I have 10 pair I'm sold on them.
Only reason for 4 stars. The shoes I received do NOT have the type of laces shown, which was a major factor in deciding to buy this shoe. I have another pair in a different color that does have the shown lace, and I like them much better. I'm a bit disappointed because the laces shown look better and you don't have to mess with tying them. I will probably write the seller and ask if they can send me the laces shown. But, it's not really worth the hassle of retuning the shoes. If Cushe wasn't such a great product I would have slammed this, but I just can't!",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Although these can hardly be called ""shorties"" -- they hit mid-thigh -- they are definitely comfortable ""smoothers.""  I can wear mine all day, and I only occasionally remember that I'm wearing them.  A medium fits a pants size 8-10.

I was a little surprised to see how sheer these are, without any seams at the bottom.  But the lack of hem is a great idea since no one can see the line where the shapewear ends.  (If you buy too small, you might see a difference between the compressed area and your thigh.)  Because they are so sheer, the amount of control is light, but the smoothing factor is strong.  Especially under tight or stretchy pants, these smooth out bumps nicely.  Yeah, they don't work miracles, but they can make your body look sleeker than it is.

I'm always concerned that shapewear, particularly the kind that targets thighs, will ride up.  On a full, 16-hour day of wearing the shorty shapewear,  this might happen two or three times at most, and it's never so bad that it's uncomfortable or visible.  I never feel the pinch at my waist that I had with another brand that I tried.  Perhaps because these offer moderate control -- as opposed to full-on squeezing -- they are the most comfortable shapewear I've worn.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"So I ordered without really paying attention to details. Keep in mind that although the some people say it rolls, it really depends on how you apply it! I'm 5'5 147lbs. I'm not chubs, slimmer side BUT with a tummy apparently..I wish it was gone but oh well. Now I got a medium..the torso part goes all the way to my under boobs. I haven't tried making it go higher. But I can say my thighs and stomach feel tighter. It also lifts your butt, which is a plus! Give it a try. You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing.

Cons: it's tight, not as tight from the stomach as I would like. I did read some reviewers left this comment as well. It doesn't hurt from the torso as others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line helps it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll.

Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good.

I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.  I could have even gone small, so for skinny people these could be too loose. I was pleasantly  surprised w pant and It's a forgiving style. Of course this is just my opinion everyone has different shapes. Hope this helps
  REVISION;  Ok have to revise my feedback. I washed these pants, shrank 1full size, no longer forgiving color , no longer cute. They didn't soften up in wash, they were stiff, but I thought they pressed them. They are 90%cotton. These pants are now just OK , I'll wear 4 sleeping only but nt even soft.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"First off, I have to say I made a mistake buying this, not carefully checking the size; it's too small for me. Not so much so that I can't use it, so I'll keep it, but I would have passed on it had I realized how much smaller than my prior bag this is.

On the positive side, this is made of a sturdy canvas that I expect will hold up well. It has plenty of pockets: an external velcro-sealed pocket on either end (a bit small for my glasses case); a large internal compartment; and, within that, a zippered internal pocket. There are three pockets outside the main compartment under the flap, two sealable with velcro. These can be used for small items such as a cell-phone or calculator.

On the downside, the main compartment lacks any zipper or other fastener, so items can come tumbling out. The side pockets are a bit small, and one of the three pockets under the flap also lacks a closure.  Also, the strap is not long enough for my needs. I'm fairly tall and I like the bag to come down to my hip. This bag rides too high and feels a bit odd when I wear it. These are minor complaints, however, so I only deducted one star.

Overall, I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a good sling bag for everyday, light use.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.

There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I have had quite a history with wearing jeans - there was a phase when I could pass off as a bum, and then another phase when I could pass as a bloated stick figure - and sadly each of those phases (and others in between) have been immortalized in my family photographs.
When I opened the box for these and put them on, however, it was like I had finally met my soulmate.

The 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit. I believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit. However it is nowhere close to being skinny. In my opinion these are best suited for my body type (I am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs). They hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy.

They look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes. I haven't had a chance to wear them with boots - but I think they would do okay with boots as well (I do not like bootcuts).

The Dirt Rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph (not necessarily a bad thing) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued.

Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight.

It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I can't say enough about this dress!  It is very simple but perfect in all the ways. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits perfect in the bust with a nice V neckline. The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller. I will be purchasing more in other colors. Perfect for a hot day when you want to be cool, stylish, and comfortable and all for the right price!

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fits after it's been washed.  So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it was good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrinks it'll be fine), the sleeves were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL.  So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect.  Which means, once washed, these sleeves will be far too short.  Actually, I bet these *are* sleeves for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves.  I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be?  Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nubs for arms?  I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"This has to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bras I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small. I would certainly love to have a drawer full of these bras, as I personally could not ask for anything better made, more reasonable priced or with a better fit than this bra.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I received this belt and I had to return it right away. The Seller did not object, and kindly offered to pay for shipping costs involved. NOTHING was wrong or objectionable with the belt, but despite my efforts to compare my shoes which I placed next to three different computer screens, the color did not match the pair of shoes that I wanted this belt to match.

The reason for this review is because of an issue that I consider of great importance. It is about the Buckle.

Other Sellers offer Ratchet Belts with not only an exceedingly heavy buckle but their buckles have a visible layer of paint. An unacceptable condition occurs when ~in the restroom~ one pulls slacks down. The heavy buckle will drag on the floor, and after several trips to the restroom, approximately half of the painted area has no paint any more. It looks ugly !

This Seller offers the exact same belts with a reliable Ratchet Mechanism and very nice looking leather; but...

Difference #1: the buckle accurately replicate the appealing look of a conventional buckle used for centuries.
Difference #2: there is no paint to scratch.
Difference #3: the buckle is lighter.

BOTTOM LINE - If you guys out there do not want to invest some good money in a belt that everyone notices it is all scratched out and looks ugly just days after you start wearing it, then, this Seller's has resolved that issue brilliantly.

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

,Clothes,1.0,OR,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?

My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly.

So I decided to give Carhartt a try. I have recently switch to their jeans because of quality dropping in my usual brand and style so I decided to give these a try. They are strongly constructed and look good. Not as much room in the seat and thigh area as I would like but I'm getting used to it. Have been washed a few times and the color has not faded.

Some are saying that they feel rough and stiff. Well, yeah. Compared to my previous brand (which I will probably by for casual occasions and not need to was as frequently), these aren't very soft. But I was going for durable. While I work in an office, I do have to do some physical stuff. May I suggest using a liquid fabric softener. I always use it and have no problem with these pants.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking).

VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS.

Size:
Runs one size small, as many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.)  I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know.

Height:
At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not as curiously high as as many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5s surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would.

Fit:
Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me.

Quality/Warmth:
Leather is soft and nice.
Lining is ideal and warm.
The top studs actually keep the laces in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special needs there) a just average).
Can't attest to durability bc they're new.
And, of course, the laces provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper lets you keep it that way (and makes the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot.

There is a slippery finish on the soles that i was sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rubs off as you wear it. Still - makes you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing.  Not cool. Lost a star.",,

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone.

,Clothes,1.0,OR,"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.  I will come back to these in the fall and see if I can make them work.  Quality-wise, they're great, so no problem there.",,

The dress is a bit big on me but it fits well and is flattering. I highly recommend this dress. I bought these for my mom who is a nurse and she loves them. She has a lot of work to do and it's hard to find a bra that is comfortable and warm for her. They are also very comfortable for her to wear. She's 5'2"" and they fit her perfectly. My only complaint is that the straps are way too long for her. I'm not sure why. This is my second pair of these, and I really like them. The material is good, but the sole is way too loose for me. The sole is a little stiff, but I feel like the shoe will last. The color is nice, but it isn't exactly the brown color I was looking for.",,
,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I was kind of hoping these would replace my current brown everyday work shoes (Doc Martin-looking Sketchers oxfords).  They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather.  More of a spring/fall shoe.  They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper.  The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather.  This makes them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all.  I deemed them to ""fit as expected"" because as a 7.5, the 8s were a little big on me.  Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes.  They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide).  At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them.
Update:  I should also emphasize that the soles aren't very supportive.  They sort of have a ""barefoot"" feel like 5-toe shoes or minimal running shoes -- not a bad thing at all, but might not work for some.  You might say they are like a moccasin dressed up as an oxford.",,

Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper.

I can tell you that putting the ring sizer band on first and then your ring was a big fail. It works better looped around the band and then slid the bands down your finger around the area the ring will sit, make sure the looped area on the ring is turned towards your palm side and then stretch the bands a bit to get you ring on and slide into place. The bands are comfortable but do peak out of the band, and I have a pretty wide ring. I keep tucking them back under the ring. I haven't broken one yet but my wife is on her second one already and it hasn't even been a week. I think she should have gotten a size smaller on the bands and thats why it broke.

I don't know why, but my family has a lot of fun with masks and costumes, well past their typical use day and age suggestions. So I knew that we'd have fun with this one. I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.

This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.

It came in a nice blue box, like others have said, the stickers do not remove easily for re-use, but you could always put your own sticker over it if you wanted to re-use the box.

Inside the box was a black suede drawstring pouch sitting atop the foamy padding in generally find in jewelry packing.

As for the bracelet itself, it's beautiful.  My 18 yr daughter loves it, so I imagine I'll be sharing.

It feels rather luxurious to be wearing all of these pearls, which are intertwined with a dark brown string and crystals.  The crystals have a great sparkle to them which adds an element of bling to the pearls.  The pearls are large in size, and definitely potato shaped.

The pearls do have markings on them which do appear to be from tools, many of the pearls are unmarked though and I don't feel like it distracts from the beauty.

As for the brown cord, it clearly shows the brown cord in the photos, so it's to be expected and I don't mind it one bit.

The size of the bracelet is a bit on the small size.  I am smaller boned and don't have tiny wrists, but they are probably smaller than average and I feel most comfortable using the extender when clasping the bracelet together.

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

The soles are comfortable give good traction on wet and dry surfaces. I walk 2 miles a day in these and my feet do not hurt.  Reebok's DMX Foam may have something to do with that.

Reebok DMX Foam is a soft and responsive foam compound used to deliver long-lasting cushioning. The focus is to deliver cushioning in the areas players need it most at the ideal time. In the footbed area, DMX Foam is soft and cushioned for high levels of comfort. Meanwhile, closer to the ground, DMX Foam is sturdier and more responsive to provide shock absorption as feet hit the ground.

I think I will be sticking with Reebok in the future because of their consistancy. My Reebok sneakes have lasted me about 9 months on average with everyday wear though.

I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

Update: These were perfect and now after trip they use it on long bike rides with dad.

I liked it so much that I got one for myself for my Scotland trip in Oct. I can not do heavy backpacks and when out being a tourist, purses are a bother. Great for plane as will hold a travel blanket, fire and tablet, phone and cords plus a bottle.

It is not even a thin elastic. I would not recommend it. Also, it is not a good material for wearing under a bra or on a tank top.

I am size one and the waist and hips of size one usually fits on me aside from the legs part. They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part. The hip is also a bit higher than my usual preference but that is fine since I don't tuck my shirts. I wish that the front pockets are a little deeper. These are the down sides when purchasing clothes online. Even if you got your size there is no guarantee that it fits exactly the same. Others are cut differently and sometimes smaller or bigger on you. I will just have to remedy it since thats what I normally do. Despite that the jeans was well made and the stitches are sturdy.

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged
Inconsistent sizing across styles
Poor assembly at seams - fraying sewn in at crotch",,

I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch.

This is not a watch for everyday use. This is for sportsmen, to be strapped atop bulky clothing. The watch feels very strong and rugged, good for rough sports activity. Were I to see a man wearing this watch at a formal function, I'd think he was ""trying too hard"" to impress, wearing such a gaudy (albeit attractive) timepiece.

I've read that watches are declining in sales, because so many people now rely on their smart phones to know the time. Watches are increasingly being used as jewelry, or to make a statement. This watch is certainly eye-catching. But this watch is also useful if you're wrapped in bulky sports clothes, and don't want to fumble for the smart phone in your pocket.

Plus, this watch has a second hand. My smart phone provides no way for me to measure the passing of seconds. So this watch also serves as a stop watch.

My watch came with the WRONG MANUAL. It came in a nice box, with a nice paper manual. But the watch described in the manual is not the one that came in the box. My watch's face and features are entirely different from the diagrams of the watch in the manual. For instance, my watch only has a second hand, not the 1/10 of a second hand pictured in the manual.

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)",,

Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!",,

The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.

August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.

If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.

The straps are not too long, which makes it easier to pull on.  The pockets are also nice.  The color is bright and I love it.  It's also a little hard to find in the stores, but I will be buying more.  I'm not a big fan of the wide width of this shoe, but I'm happy with the look and feel of the shoe.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"These boys pajamas are great for my toddler son now that the summer heat is approaching us quickly. These pajamas are made of 100% cotton and wash nicely. They are not the softest pajamas I have purchased for him, but after a couple washes/dries they have already gained a more comfortable feel. They're nice and lightweight for the summer heat. I purchased size 3T for my 34"", 30 pound 18 month old and they fit great with some room to grow in. He typically wears 2T-3T in clothing, so I'd say these are true to size. The shirt is long and narrow - it has a nice fit on my son. I like that this shirt is tag less - my kiddo often tugs at shirts with tags, as his skin is quite sensitive. The shorts come down to his knees and are a ""fitted"" style but a little loose on my boy. I like that in pjs - I feel that would be more comfortable during his sleep. My son enjoys wearing his new pjs and actually pulled them out of his pajama draw to wear when it was time to get ready for bed. He approves!

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"This is the fourth Skagen watch I've owned.  It's my favorite so far, but all of them have been great. The first is still working, but is looking a little worn, due to my having worn it as a ""barn"" watch whil working with my horses, and also during various other outside activities.  It even survived an accidental laundering, and still worked.  The second watch was very pretty and a little more stylish, but developed a problem with coming unlatched--lost it while shopping, and I imagine someone found themselves a nice watch. The third watch is still nice, with the exception of several broken strands of metal on the band.  I will probably have the band replaced and use it as a back up, since it still works fine.  The only other thing any of these has ever required is the occasional battery replacement.

As to my present watch, it's my favorite because I really like the style; it's small enough not to overwhelm my small wrist, but easy to read.  It's the typical, practical Skagen stainless steel, but polished enough to be dressy.  The gold tone numbers make it more versatile, as it blends well with gold tone jewelry.  The band seems to be a little heavier quality than the other watches, and was much easier to adjust the length. The only problem I can speak of, and it's a very minor one, is that the stem is a little stiff and it was hard to turn when setting the time.  This shouldn't be an issue after the initial set up, so it doesn't detract from my rating this watch excellent.",,

I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy.

I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals.

PROs:
Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest!
Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps!
Excellent supporting foot-bed.
Quality materials.  Love the leather smell!
Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement.
Sole - perfect on all surfaces!
Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun!
Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes.
Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.

You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"There were three questions I had in mind when I received these gloves in the mail:
1) How well do they work on touch screens (""capacitive material"")?
2) Will they keep my hands warm (""Cold Weather Gear"")?
3) Will they last?

1) When I first opened these gloves, my first take was that they were merely knit gloves with different thread color on the finger tips.  But after putting them on and looking closer, the three finger tips (first two fingers + thumb) are indeed made of a different material that provided a high degree of responsiveness on our iPad.  Score one for the gloves!  Alas, I had less luck with my iPhone, where my thumb is needed for typing.  There is a seam that runs across the top of the thumb exactly where my fingers come into contact with iPhone, rendering the ""Capacitive Material"" useless.  WIth a slight roll of my thumb, or shifting of the seam, I could get them to work properly.  But definitely a design flaw.

2) I ran an errand first thing the next morning - about 25 degrees outside.  Based on the knit material, I was less than surprised to discover these gloves lack sufficient warming properties to qualify is ""Cold Weather Gear.""  I would not recommend these much below 45 or 50 degrees.

3) The material is highly porous with skin visible through the material.  There were loose threads as well, straight out of the package.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

I look forward to using this jacket a lot in the future!",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"We are heading to Maui and are planning a snorkel trip to the Molokini crater, but have gotten the worst sunburns from snorkeling in the past, because the sunscreen washes off so quickly in the salt water.

Pros
- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.
- The unique white stitching gives it some style (over just plain black).
- We ordered one size up from his normal size, and it fits quite snugly, so the sizing is about
  two sizes smaller than his typical American size shirt.
- It is well sewn and dries quickly.

Cons
- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

I would purchase this product again.

I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on.
Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose.
Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly.
Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.

But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.

I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.

The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I purchased this bag in truffle which is a dark grayish color with a bright pink/coral inner liner color,  I wanted a convertible bag family vacations and the safety features made this the perfect bag for that.  Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.
The main reason I selected a convertible bag is I wanted something that is a backpack for being hands free or it can be switched to a crossbody bag for going into a museum or a place that you can't have a backpack.
My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.  I took a seam ripper and took it off (you can't cut it because the metal that runs through it to make it slash/cut proof) and I will just use the metal hoops for the strap when I use it as a crossbody bag.

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years. In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores. Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare. I love them but replacement has been needed. After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand. The  stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25. The  Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly. No two pair seem the same.  However, The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent. The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.

Not having a local source for the Levi brand, I ordered through Amazon. The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglers
available locally. Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers. As a matter of fact, it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.

The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult  jeans. The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son's boy jeans.

Last, the jean's waist and length were at least 2 inches large. Years ago, Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.

In summary, the fabric, the zipper, and inconsistent sizes are all  very sub-par. The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.

This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I love this hat. The styling is super cute, especially with the bow at the back. It seemed to fit about the same as most standard ladies hats of this type, possibly a little looser as I have a big head and tend to find most hats slightly small until they have been broken in and stretched. This fit well from the get-go. There is a slight amount of adjustability (there's a velcro closure by the bow on the back) but not much. The construction on it is solid and seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear - already been through the wash once after being thrown in a mud puddle and stepped on by my toddler, and it still looks good as new. I purchased the dark violet color - it's definitely not violet, more of a light tweedy brown - BUT it is the exact color that it shows on the computer screen. So ignore the words and go off of the picture :) Huge brim is great for the beach, reading, gardening, or just everyday wear to protect your face from the sun. Please note, the brim does NOT extend all the way around the back. It almost gives this hat more of a bonnet look than the oversized sun hats one often thinks of.

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer).",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.

I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.
Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.

This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.
I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.
The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.

I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.

There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).

The dress does not look like much when taken out of the plastic bag - the Navy Blue seems somewhat dull, and the fabric is soft cotton jersey, somewhat thin.
But boy, does it transform when put on! The pattern is really flattering and is really smart - though made in China, it is made for larger-boned European women and is very flattering. Here's what worked on my 5.4, 165-lb, slightly pregnant (and suddenly size 12 instead of 8) frame:
- Shoulders fit just right - nothing cuts into armpits, nothing falls off - sleeves start where they are supposed to start
- Sleeves themselves are of decent length - not too short, they run to mid-palm and can be pulled up slightly
- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"This review is for the Ekouaer Womens Satin Robe Wedding Party Wear (Red, XL).

This nightgown is elegant, classic and feminine. I got the red color, the red was a little brighter than I expected but really very lovely. I also purchased the XL size. I am a size 12/14 and it does fit but its a little small. If you are a larger then a size 14 this will NOT completely tie closed. It does tie closed on me, but its open in at the bottom and doesnt completely wrap like its supposed to.

The fabric is a beautiful, soft red satin. This does need ironing so if you are traveling with it, pack a travel steamer. I think its because the fabric is so delicate. Despite the fabric being so satiny, this is NOT see through, so if you are wearing your bra and panties underneath you cant see them when its completely closed.

The lace detail is amazing, the neckline has THICK bandings of lace sewn down the front, the sleeves have lace trim and it goes up into the sleeve to give it some design flare. The lace is white or slightly off white, but it is VERY QUALITY lace and not unraveling, falling off or threatening to tear at any part. In fact, the craftsmanship and detail of this robe on a whole is VERY well made, this is something you would pay a lot of money for at the higher end retail stores. If you like delicate lingerie that is classy and makes you look good, try this robe out and you will enjoy it! 5/5 stars

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"How cute (or sexy!) are these? What a fantastic idea, they took something that was needed by millions of women (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of colors here on Amazon as well as their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small was just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumptions on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big.

This is very well made and has built in clear silicone rings - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I was hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture...

This works well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed as any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands).

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Beautiful earrings! These were delivered to me by my mailman during the middle of my annual memorial day party. Everyone kept asking what did you get??? What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.
These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol.

I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.

I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!

If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

I tried to get it on, and it was too tight to wear. The shoe also had a hole in the side, so I had to return it. I think the front part of the shoe has a hole in it, but that's not the case with this shoe. The shoe was very comfortable, and I'd recommend it. I'm very happy with this purchase!

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon.",,

Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support.

I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would!

I usually wear 8-8.5, and though I prefer a wide, I can wear most regular width shoes. These happen to fit me beautifully, but they don't seem like a true wide width right out of the box. However, the beauty of good quality leather boots is that they will stretch to fit over time. (Google has several good ideas for breaking in leather shoes. Though I didn't need it this time, the rubbing alcohol trick totally works.) I expected these to be tight, but they're not. My calves are about 14.5 inches, and the boots do fit over my leggings or jeans, but with NO room to spare. Keep that in mind if you have large calves. (I noticed that Timberland is now making this type of boot with an elastic inset in the shaft for wider calves. I don't think they are nearly as cute, though.) This boot is GORGEOUS. The leather is such a great color (tobacco) and it looks even prettier now that I've used mink oil on it. I can't wait for Fall so I can wear these boots all the time. They seem to be very well made, very expensive looking. I have short legs, so I love that they stop a few inches below the knee. If they were any taller, I think they'd look like they were wearing me, instead of the other way around. These are absolutely lovely. So many tall boots look cheap or gaudy to me, but these are wonderful. They are so comfortable already, and I know they will only get better.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"UPDATE May 20th ... Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.

I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.

The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.

The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.

Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.

In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.

For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate.

He has a small head, but I thought the length would be a little longer. I'm 5'2"" and the pants are a little snug. I ordered the Large because I normally wear a small and it fits great.

I'm 5'2"", so it's a little long on my son, but I'm sure he will be fine. He's usually a size 14, so I ordered a size up. He looks great with it, and I am pleased with the quality.I ordered the size 7 and it fit perfectly.  I think I will order a size down, but I will buy more.  The quality is nice.I love the way it looks and the price.  I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly",,
,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I was looking for a nice casual dress that I could wear for the spring and summer and luckily the opportunity came along to try this one. I likes it so much that I immediately ordered another in red and I might even get another color.
The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right.
I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant.
I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill.
You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather.
The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing.
It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I really want to give this watch 5 stars, this watch is excellent, high quality, accurate, and great looking, but it loses a star for the weight. Don't get me wrong though i understand all types of these watches are going to be heavy when compared to my g shocks. Wearing the watch daily is not very comfortable, it is a bit heavy and can get sweaty during the summer which is normal, but after weaing my casio g shock which cost $150. I really appreciated the lightweight and comfort of the affordable g shock watch. The seiko is indeed a classy watch but the downside is that is it heavier than my g shock which i end up choosing to wear daily.

This is a great watch for going out and relaxing, but for sports, work, daily tasks, the g shock is my goto watch since its lighter weight and more comfortable with its resin band.

It is hard to make a steel watch very comfortable compared to a resin watch. Otherwise everything else is perfection..Seiko is one of my favorite brand of watches, I would say my top favorite, then Casio, but realistically my daily wear is a casio g shock. If you type of watch is the classy look, then seiko is the best. It's kinetic technology is my favorite, i love how it adjust back to the correct time after i wake it up by a few shakes. It is amazing how accurate this watch is, I set the time and date once, and have had this watch for 4 years and not once did i ever need to readjust the time or date, it has been accurate this whole time.  this watch is excellence, but i deduct one star because I feel its a bit heavy as it should be but just not my cup of tea for a daily wear since I have a lightweight casio g shock as my option.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"As stated by the title...this product is NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE!  The zippered opening does not allow for someone much taller than about 5'11"" to get into it.  If you are short, you can get into the costume easily feet first.  If you are tall, you must go in head first, lay down and cross your legs and get someone to help you put your feet into the correct places.  I could BARELY bend my legs enough to fit them into the leg openings, even having wiggled my shoulders up into the head area as much as I could.  Now as long as you're under that height I mentioned, your weight doesn't matter a bit.  It's a very forgiving costume and would be very easy for a plus size person to wear.  I don't know what the limit would be, but we were able to get my ~300lb friend into it with no trouble.

The fan makes an annoying sound...so it's not like you could wear this to work and sit at your computer quietly.  But changes are...you're going to be running around like an idiot at a party in this thing so nobody will care about the fan whirr.

It does get hot inside and you will fog up the thing.  There's no way for this really to be avoided.  Costume feels super cheap when you take it out of the package and you'll need to find somewhere inside the suit to secure the fan.  I'm unable to wear this costume without having someone help me get in and out of it, due to my height, but if you're shorter you should be able to manage ok.

You can run, walk, bicycle, drive, sit, dance, all very easily.  It's very light and if you bump into something, it just deflates that part and fills right back up quickly.  Fun to run around in and scare children.",,

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"The problem with buying a dress shirt, is that they are cut to fit 95% of the guys out there. So they are boxy.

I have the problem of shirts too tight around my shoulders and upper arms. Also, I can't move my arms forward without restriction, because it's too tight across the back. Sometimes I move up to a 2XL, but then it's way too baggy around my stomach. I have no idea what those muscleheads do who are jacked up on gear, but just being thick and solid, causes me problems enough. Since my thighs are pretty strong, I have problems with pants that I can sit down in too. That's when I discovered spandex woven into the cloth. If you're bulked up from the gym, its the only option you have, unless you want to buy clothes way oversized, and wear a belt. This shirt fits me well. It isn't tight around my arms and shoulders, since the cloth has give, when I move my arms. The waist doesn't billow over my waist either. I have long arms, but it fits well with arm length. The fabric has give, but it's not elastic the way socks are for example. Also you can forget to hang this shirt on a hanger, and still be able to wear it the next day without ironing. (It smooths out, when you have it on.) I like the blue graph paper design. Best of all, I'm not pinched around my chest and back either.

I live in the southwest & I wear sandals even in the winter, and I walk an insane amount as I am in a personal weight loss program & walking is the kindest to my joints which have issues from my serious athletic days of basketball, performance dance, ballet & cheerleading...so I walk everyday, everywhere  up to 2-3 miles depending on my schedule and Gezer holds up and because of the arch & toes supports they are comfortable the entire time.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I'm discriminating. Willing to pay for better/best quality. However, I planned to use this for a Disney Trip (2 adults, 2 kids) and I wanted a carry on as a back pack (to free my hands for car seats), then a smaller back pack for the park (instead of just a wheeled backpack only which would have been much bigger in the park than I wanted). This was fantastic. No problems on domestic flight with wheeled part (with day pack zipped off). Fit no problem straight in. Squishing straps great. I did NOT have much trouble with the pull arm as some reviewers, slight sticking at times but better than most of my luggage (NOT as good as my Victorinox for a comparison, but still very good). Zippers heavy duty and work well. Day pack holds much more than I expected, more like a true backpack (I had expected a little larger than a fanny pack. This is MUCH larger than that.). Water bottle slots hold CamelBak style bottles fine. Little compartment at top for earphones, charger, inhaler, medicines and front compartment held sunglasses, wipes, sunblock stick, snacks, etc. Main compartment had two rain jackets, two sweaters, magazines, sandwiches, snacks, baseball caps. My wife didn't really have to carry anything in the park. Even with all that, it slid right under the seat no problem, with room for my feet still. Some noted trouble zipping the day pack onto the main pack when full. I didn't bother as it has a nice ""hold a bag"" strap (like the Victorinox) that worked great, so didn't bother zipping on. If both full of hard objects, I could see some trouble, but if relatively flat, should zip on no problem. However, look around!! I found for just under $100 elsewhere. For that it was a steal. For the $175-200 range, I still think it is worth it (now that I have it). Bite the bullet, you are really getting two really good bags for one.",,

,Clothes,3.0,OR,"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.

I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.

The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.

I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.

I lowered the ratings to three after one month due to these two problems.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I am absolutely blown away by these pearls. I am a jewelry fanatic and these pearls are such high quality it blows me away. I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items. I ordered these pearls thinking they would be excellent for the baby photos however, this set is more appropriate once she is a teenager. The size of the pearls is almost as large as my adult size necklaces and the length is only an inch smaller than my adult size necklaces!  This set is a fantastic value. I must admit, when I saw the High quality and great size of these pearls along with the excellent knotting between each individual pearl, I immediately put it around my own neck and looked in the mirror. I think these make excellent casual pearls for a small framed woman!  These are a fantastic value. In my photos I have this necklace along with my own pearl necklace which was around 1k I believe but that was so many years ago, I don't remember. I think the size of these pearls is FANTASTIC, the shapes of the individuals don't have the consistency and perfect shape as my older pearls have but this is because these are cultured pearls. I think the cultured look adds to the intrigue of this piece. I got the ribbon that is baby blue and I think it's the perfect shade and complements the necklace well.

There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus.",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",,

I would recommend this dress to everyone. I love this wallet and it's beautiful. I usually carry a large or small purse when traveling. This one fits very well and the back pockets are very nice and I can't wait to wear it out. I don't have any problems with the wallet being empty. I bought a small and it fit fine. It is well made and it is very comfortable. I was very pleased with this purchase. It is a nice little wallet, but I would not buy it again. I am very happy with the quality. I love these boots!

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

I wish I could give these sandals more than 5 stars. They're perfect. I am a very, very satisfied customer!",,

I like the quality of this shirt. I'll be getting more of it. The material is soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected.

This is a good quality wallet. I wear it everyday, but when I put it on, I lose a lot of weight. It's very durable and it keeps me organized. It's a very nice wallet.

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band.
I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat.
This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once.
I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like.

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size...",,

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"This is a classy looking watch.  I don't get much opportunity to ""dress up"" these days, and its nice to have an inexpensive watch to have ""on reserve"" for those events where it does happen.  Typically I'm wearing my casio tough solar watch with a suit, and it doesn't look right (even if it is a good representation of ""the real me"").

Now with the Armitron I'll have an appropriate watch to wear ""occasionally"".

You may want to pick up a watch sizing kit, I have one because I'm buying most of my watches online these days. This is the one I have:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GGI-International-WTK-037-Metal-Watch-Repair-Kit/dp/B00K7JSMOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GGI International WTK-037 Metal Watch Repair Kit</a>&nbsp;its very highly rated.  Its easier than taking your watch into a shop.  I live in a household of 6, so whenever anyone gets a watch I can just adjust it easily.

I think the lack of a calendar function is a huge plus.  Calendar functions never work that well, whenever you have a month that only has 30 days then your calendar is ""off"" and you have fiddle with it.  There are so many other ways for me to know the proper date, like my cell phone and my computer, that I don't need my watch to provide that information.  just the time is fine.

The fit is comfortable.  The red color is pleasing when worn with dressy or dressy casual clothing.

The negatives:
1) the presentation box arrived damaged, which if you were going to give it as a gift would be undesirable.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars:  well, to do that it would have to have something about it that I thought was truly excellent and made it stand out in its field. Also at the time of this review it was not clear to me what the retail price is.  This is a very nice watch, and I like it, but I don't really know how good a value it is.  I'll come back later and update it if it comes back into stock.",,

,Clothes,5.0,OR,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

,Clothes,4.0,OR,"I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.

UPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.

Take the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.",,

,Clothes,2.0,OR,"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

And to sell a jacket as a 3-in-1 systems jacket........it needs to really be a 3-in-1 systems jacket.  This jacket does not have a removeable liner!",,

I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.",,
